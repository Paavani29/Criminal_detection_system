This project introduces the Surveillance System for Criminal Detection, a cuttingï¿½edge solution designed to leverage advanced technologies for efficient monitoring and 
identification of potential threats. Facial detection, utilizing the Histogram of Oriented Gradients 
(HOG) algorithm, forms a core component of this Surveillance System. This algorithm excels in 
accurately identifying human faces under various conditions, enhancing the system's ability to 
detect and recognize individuals of interest. Moreover, to ensure the security of sensitive data, 
The Surveillance System employs Residue Number System (RNS) encryption and decryption via 
the Chinese Remainder Theorem. These encryption techniques ensure the integrity and 
confidentiality of data within the surveillance network. By integrating facial detection algorithms 
and advanced encryption techniques, Surveillance System aims to provide law enforcement 
agencies and security personnel with a powerful tool for identifying and mitigating criminal 
activities effectively. This paper outlines the framework of SSCD and its contribution to 
enhancing public safety in the face of evolving security challenges.
